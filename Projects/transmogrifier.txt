Plans for a new program that writes programs! It will be the transmogrifier, after the shape-changing device from Calvin and Hobbes, and it will use statements of english from a list (kind of like a reverse thesaurus) to create program statements in any of several programming languages as it is possible. The tm should be able to move almost directly from pseudocode to a finished program, but will be able to guide anyone with an understanding of "process" to a finished program if they actually have a specific goal in mind for the process to operate toward. It will probably have to be written in lisp, but it occurs to me that it can be written in any Turing-complete language, so I may try doing it in PyQt first, just to see how it works, because that is so much easier for me. It will take a while, but maybe not as long as all that, since the execution of it will take only as long as needed to get it to accomplish writing Python from the standard library.
