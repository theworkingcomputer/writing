	Well, folks, I have quite a lot to write about. First, though, I need to
reach out to the hacker community (if there is any such thing ... I have some
doubts ... it seems as if hacker space is just shorthand for humanity, with its
cliques and cabals, tribes and territories ...) and give us all a slap in the 
face. Or several.

	Yep.

	We need it.

	It's time for somebody in this community to talk about poverty. Really
talk about it.

	I've read a lot of posts from people who say that money is not
important. What's really important is to do what you need to do, something
bigger than yourself, or something that gives you fulfillment, or something that
makes you feel good about getting up in the morning. Don't work for the money, 
they say, because, once you have it, things are not any better. This, my
friends and neighbors, enemies and colleagues, is bullshit. 

	Slap one (1).

	We are full of shit unless we recognize that, for every person in my
country (the USA, for those who are keeping score of that kind of stuff) who
makes money each day, going to work || (good job or bad, doesn't matter how you		[or not]
call it) there is a person who loses money. Every day, every minute, man, woman,
child, black, white, asian, latino, african, european. That's how much poverty
there is. And I'm not talking about the 99% and the 1%, here. There's a line,
drawn across the heart of every group of people in this country. Half of them
gain, at least some, every day. The other half loses. Every day.

	And the thing is, if you're in the "gain" half, you don't know how it is
for the "lose" half. You don't know what it's like. You can't. But maybe you can
imagine it. Some.

	We're going to try, right here. We'll just go a little bit over the
line. "Lose" some.

	Imagine that you are a father. || You have worked since you were in high	[Work at it. Really imagine it. Make it your life.]
school, did a great apprenticeship, became a professional. You married, and had
two kids. Things happen. You take the advice of your friends, family,
government, everyone; you go back to college, finish your degree, follow your
muse, and get a fine education; better than you ever could have when you were
eighteen, just out of high school. Because you have to work while you do this,
it takes a decade. Because your family is not able to take much of a cut in its
standard of living (at least, so you believe), you take out loans to help out.
Then you're out of school, and you start to look for work in your field. Well,
that doesn't exist. You have to get more school (at this point you have two
bachelor's degress and two Master's -- follow your bliss, right?), and |that| just	[More school]
sounds like a very long drag on everything, plus it will take until you are
fifty-five years old. || You don't really even know your wife any more, so ...		[house is gone in the real-estate debacle --]

course, not in your previous field, because that's full of people who want to do	[-- just to survive --]
it; you followed your bliss elsewhere. ... There are education jobs, so you do
that for a while. Ten bucks an hour (and lots of vacations, good heathcare--used
to be, anyway) ... and most of that is taken for child support (not complaining,
but there's not enough here to pay the loans that already supported the wife and
kids, much less the interest now, nor any for even one person to live on). Your
new relationship is barely there because, let's face it, it's nice to be able to
see a movie or something, once in a while. ... Every day, you go a little
farther in the hole, even if you just pay rent and utilities and get your food
out of dumpsters. Really. And you're way better off than most poor folks.

	That's a little bit of the picture. I think many of you can imagine most
of the things I described in that paragraph, at least one at a time. I put it to
each of you that, as you read, you worked, in your mind, to see how you would
solve each of those problems as I described them.

	Slap two (2).

	You fucked it up. That's not how it works. You get all those problems,
at once, all the time. Then you get all the other problems. Can't work today
because your kid is out of school and you can't afford a sitter (no, you can't;
nobody watches kids for free, here, and you're across the country from the free-
babysitting-relatives, 'cause you followed your bliss ... right?), so you lose
a little money and hopefully not your job, and the power will be shut off unless
you give them a hundred bucks||, and you're almost out of heating oil, and it's		[today]
getting close to christmas so you get a high-interest credit card and hail-mary
the presents, hoping for a big tax refund in February (you can put them off that	[because otherwise there's no christmas at all]
long); but you're behind in your child support thanks to your low-paying job, so	[none]
the court takes your refund. ... Getting the picture? A little?

	Depressed yet?

	This is a little bit like my life. I have some things better, and some
things worse. I'm well on the "lose" side of the line; but: I am way better off
than most folks on the "lose" side. Ah, hell. Lets just call it like it is,
right? We're losers. The best of us are losers. Everybody on the "gain" side of
the line? They're winners. The worst of them is still a winner.

	Slap three (3).

	You fucked up again. Or, still. You think there is a way out for us.
It could be education (that's a popular one), or welfare supports, or amnesty
for whatever debts we may have. But the real problem is that we are on one side 
of a line that is enforced by behavior that is in your best interest that we
continue. In order for all the winners to stay winners, all the losers have to
stay losers. At least in their heads. They have to act like losers. They have to
spend more than they make, so that you can spend less than you make.

	Slap four (4).

	This is a big one.

	That's the way you like it. You don't want it to change. You. Ever.

	You have to come over to our side, we losers, to even make a dent in the
problem. I know. That's part of why I'm still here. See, I write software for
losers, on the side. I provide them with tech. I help them move up, a little. I
try to do it without making them even more poor. There's no money in that.

	Some of the biggest companies in this country make their money from us
losers. They point out that they have a right to make a profit, and, indeed,
they do have that right. But, in order for losers to move to the good side, the
"gain" side, someone is going to have to give them stuff (useful, durable stuff;
not the ticky-tacky crap that they can afford) that is good without taking their
money, and teach them how to use it without telling them how poor and useless
and fucked up they are. You have to believe that they are as good as you, when
you know that they're not, because they're losers and you're a winner. You have
to help them become as skilled as you, and I know you don't want to. You suck.

	You have to give them that stuff freely and honestly without making any
one person ever feel even a tiny bit guilty about it, and you have to give it
without making money yourself from them being losers. (There goes the 401K.
Where did you think those winner-institutions got their money? From other
winners?)

	Slap-I'm-starting-to-lose-track-and-you-should-be-bleeding-by-now.

	At least I hope you are. Because you suck. You tell us (the losers), and
each other, that money does not matter. That it doesn't make a difference.

	You lie.

	Slap.

	Slap.

	Slap.

	You suck, and I hope it hurts. But I know that, really, it doesn't hurt
at all (certainly not enough), because you're not losers.

	Go on. Go on with your life. Just go away. I'll be here with the rest of
the losers, trying to push our way up. Most of us don't much care who we hurt as
we do it. We're all losers this side of the line, anyway. Not many followers of
the "Golden Rule". It's not very rewarding to help us. Most of us will steal
your shit, and we will rarely say "Thank You".

	Yeah. We're hardly human.


********************************************************************************


	P.S. I still have hope. I am, like all of us, actually human. I still
	believe there is good everywhere, if you look for it. And, yes, before
	you ask ... I would take a good job doing just about anything, as long
	as it allowed me time for my family and my loser friends and neighbors,
	and I could get to it from here. We have to stick together, you know?
