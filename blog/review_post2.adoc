So, I promised Chrissy Lessey a review of her book, The Coven. I read it; I liked it. ... So there.

Doesn't really seem like enough, right?

Well, I believe I mentioned that I am slow, and more slow the more important something is. This is a good book, and my friend wrote it, Practically enough to induce full on stasis. Chrissy has been great, though; not a peep about the supposed review.

This morning, as I was sitting, not wanting to go to work and reading to avoid thinking about it, a metaphor popped into my head, describing the reading/writing relationship. Chrissy's book will be the first trial.

A written document is a package, just waiting to be unwrapped by a potential reader. Some documents, preserved for legal reasons, are only unwrapped by readers with specific needs, and are packaged the way precisely those readers may expect. No one else has any interest in  handling them, much less opening them and probing the intricacies of their folds and contents.

A short story is a simple package, addressed to some general reader in away to induce them to open it (start reading). Once opened, it has a interior design that, at least in an interesting story, leads the reader to conclusions or an ending planned by the author, perhaps with a couple extra interior packages to open, but not a great deal of complication. That sort of thing is for novels.

The novel "package" is complicated, even convoluted and difficult. It can't be too easy to open, or the reader has no reason to continue working at the package, reasoning, probably correctly, that they already know all of the important parts of this package just by seeing its gaudy bow and hefting its mass (a little light for its size, no?). It cannot be too difficult to open, or most readers will simply set it aside for an easier package, no matter how interesting the wrapping, or barely glimpsed shape beneath. It cannot be too heavy for its size, or too few will pick it up.

A good novel is a package that is interesting, and complex enough as to not give the contents away too soon; this novel has, perhaps, two or three subsidiary interior packages, some of which may be unfinished, or left to the readers imagination to complete. ... Maybe, on unwrapping, the reader finds that the interior package is heavier or lighter than the outer one, and , perhaps, larger. (This is something that can only happen in literature, but once livng amongst truly literate novels one finds it a common effect. How often does one find that the world of a novel is more expansive than one's own?) The really good novel is wrapped in a truly interesting way, bringing one to the contents without the realization that the story is halfway done while we are still playing with the pretty ribbons; if it is even better, we find that the same ribbons are used to neatly tie up the ending.

I have gone on about this, but it gives me a concrete descriptor for Chrissy's novel, The Coven. When I was in college the first time (Yep, there have been several times. Took me thirty years to get there, but I finished. Barely.), I would, occasionally, get packages from my mom. I could tell instantly they were from her,at a fair distance. She had a way of setting up a package that made it clear, regardless the wrapping or contents, that it was from her. Authors are often like that. I contend that it why we like some authors more than others, when they are otherwise similar, at least to the casual reader.

The best thing about Chrissy's book is her voice. I suspect that it would be hers whether she were writing a script for a music video or a descriptive sonnet on Bill Murray's comedy. I am glad she wrote a novel. It is well-plotted (the package has interesting and difficult-to-predict sub-packages of various size) and pleasant to read (like christmas, getting a new book is). The heft is good in the hand, and has some pleasantly weighty corners, as well as attractive and vivacious breezy sections. More than anything, the voice is a comfort, a sweetness, a stop-and-savor-the-goodness-of-it can't wait for another package to share with my friends.
